# Hotel Booking Data Analysis and Cancellation Prediction

Welcome to the Hotel Booking Data Analysis and Cancellation Prediction project! This comprehensive undertaking seamlessly integrates data analysis and predictive modeling to unravel the complexities of hotel bookings. From meticulous data cleaning to insightful analysis and accurate predictions, our project strives to empower the hospitality industry with actionable insights.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
This project is designed to achieve two primary objectives. Firstly, we engage in a thorough exploration of hotel booking data through robust data analysis. Secondly, armed with the insights gained, we delve into the realm of machine learning to predict hotel booking cancellations.

**Dataset:**  
Our analysis is anchored in a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse attributes related to hotel bookings. From booking details and customer demographics to reservation specifics, this dataset serves as the bedrock for our exploration, predictive modeling, and strategic decision-making.

## Key Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   The journey commences with meticulous data cleaning. This phase involves handling missing values, ensuring data consistency, and addressing any anomalies or outliers. A clean dataset is fundamental for meaningful analysis and accurate predictions.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Following data cleaning, we embark on the exploration of the dataset. EDA is not merely a step but a crucial phase dedicated to uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations. Through meticulous analysis, we aim to understand customer behavior across different demographics and seasons, providing a foundation for our subsequent predictive models.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   With the dataset now cleansed and enriched, we proceed to meticulous data preprocessing. Missing values are handled, features are scaled, and categorical variables are encoded. This step is pivotal for ensuring that our machine learning models can effectively learn from the data.

4. **Model Training:**  
   Drawing from the insights gained during EDA, we employ various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression. These models are trained on historical data to capture intricate patterns and dynamics of hotel booking cancellations.
   The performance of each model is assessed through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure that our models generalize well to new data. This step is integral to the reliability and effectiveness of our predictive models.

5. **Interpretation and Recommendations:**  
   As the models are trained and validated, we shift gears to interpretation. Insights gleaned from the models provide a roadmap for strategic decision-making. By understanding which factors most significantly influence cancellations, hotels can implement targeted strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize operations.

## Why This Matters

The amalgamation of data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling holds immense value for the hospitality industry. Beyond predicting cancellations, our project equips hotels with the knowledge to proactively manage reservations, optimize resource allocation, and elevate the overall guest experience. Join us on this exciting journey as we unravel the story within the hotel booking data.

Let's embark on the exploration of Hotel Booking Data Analysis and Cancellation Prediction!
